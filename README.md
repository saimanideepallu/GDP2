# Andriod malware detection using machine learning

Dataset was obtained from University of [New Brunswick's website](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/andmal2017.html)

Data cleaning was done using data preprocessing techniques.

Random Sampling was done to obtain a balanced dataset with 156,000 observations

Feature engineering was performed using univariate feature selection.

Five machine learning algorithms were trained using the balanced dataset and their corresponding performance was evaluated for each of the target variable.

"Label" and "Family" are used as our target variables.

A maximum accuracy of ~ 99% was obtained using Random Forest.
